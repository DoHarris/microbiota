# microbiota
This includes the mothur modified standard operating procedure (SOP), Python and R scripts that were used to assess the penile microbiota composition and diversity.
The microbiota analyses were assessed using the mothur v1.37.6 (Schloss et al., 2009: Appl Environ Microbiol. 2009;75(23):7537-7541) using the SOP guidelines (Kozich et al., 2013: Appl Environ Microbiol. 2013;79(17):5112-5120.
The steps in mothur that we used are detailed in "mothur_batch.txt"
The abundances of the bacteria at different taxonomic rank were summarized using "taxonomy_mothur_abundance_silvaDB_v1.2.py".
Alpha diversity was computed using "biodiversity_calculator.R". The alpha metrics that were computed included Simpson, Dominance, Shannon, and Shannon Equitability indices.
Beta diversity was computed using "betaDiv.R". For UniFrac analysis, a phylogenetic tree was randomly generated.
